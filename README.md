🚀 Wasm-Geo-Tracker
A high-performance web application demonstrating real-time geolocation tracking by leveraging a C++ engine compiled to WebAssembly. This project shows how to manage and display thousands of points on a map smoothly in a web browser.

✨ Live Demo Snapshot
Below is a snapshot of the application in action. It shows the user's location as a distinct blue circle and other tracked "people" as red circles that move in real-time.

(This is a static image. Imagine the red circles gently moving around!)

核心功能 (Core Features)
📍 Find My Location: Click the "Show My Location" button to use the browser's Geolocation API and place a special marker for the user.
👥 Add People: Click anywhere on the map to add a new person (a red circle).
⚡ High-Performance Core: All coordinate data is stored and updated within a C++-powered WebAssembly module, allowing for near-native speed.
🧠 Smart Rendering: The JavaScript front-end reads data directly from the Wasm module's memory ("zero-copy"), ensuring minimal overhead for rendering updates.
🗺️ Interactive Map: Built with the lightweight and robust Leaflet.js library.
🛠️ The Architecture: Why This is Fast
This project isn't just a standard JavaScript map. It uses a powerful hybrid architecture designed for performance.

Mermaid
C++ Engine (people.cpp): The heart of the application. It manages a std::vector of person coordinates. Its functions for adding people and updating positions are compiled for maximum speed.
WebAssembly Bridge (people.wasm): The compiled C++ code. This binary runs in the browser at near-native speed, far faster than equivalent complex JavaScript for heavy computation.
JavaScript Controller (main.js): The "glue." It handles user interaction, calls browser APIs (like Geolocation), and orchestrates the flow of data between the Wasm module and the rendering layer.
Leaflet.js Renderer: A simple and effective library for drawing the map tiles and the circles on top.
🚀 Getting Started
You can run this project on your local machine in just a few steps.

Prerequisites
Emscripten SDK: You need the Emscripten toolchain to compile C++ to WebAssembly. Follow the official installation guide.
Python: Needed for running a simple local web server (most systems have it pre-installed).
Installation & Running
Clone the repository:
Generated bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd wasm-map
Use code with caution.
Bash
Activate the Emscripten environment:
Navigate to your emsdk directory and run:
Generated bash
# On macOS / Linux
source ./emsdk_env.sh
Use code with caution.
Bash
This command prepares your terminal session for compilation.
Compile the C++ code to WebAssembly:
In the project directory (wasm-map), run the compilation command:
Generated bash
emcc people.cpp -o people.js -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_setUserLocation', '_addOtherPerson', '_getPeopleCount', '_getPeopleData', '_updatePositions', '_userExists']" -s EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS="['cwrap']"
Use code with caution.
Bash
This will generate people.js (the JS glue) and people.wasm (the core engine).
Start the local web server:
Generated bash
python -m http.server
Use code with caution.
Bash
View the application:
Open your web browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:8000

💡 Future Improvements
This project serves as a strong foundation. Here are some potential next steps:

WebGL Rendering: Replace Leaflet's SVG/DOM markers with a WebGL-based renderer (like Mapbox GL JS or Deck.gl) to handle 100,000+ points smoothly.
WebSockets: Connect to a real-time server via WebSockets to have a truly multi-user experience.
Spatial Indexing: Implement a Quadtree in C++ to optimize finding points within the visible map area, further boosting performance with massive datasets.
Custom Icons: Allow users to be represented by custom images instead of simple circles.
📄 License
This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.

Notes: 

Run: 
emcc people.cpp -o people.js -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_addPerson', '_getPeopleCount', '_getPeopleData', '_updatePositions']" -s EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS="['cwrap']"


Pro Tip for Later: Optimization
Once you've confirmed everything works, you can create a highly optimized "release" build. You do this by adding an optimization flag like -O2 or -O3. This tells the compiler to spend more time making the C++ and WebAssembly code as fast as possible.

Release build command

emcc -O3 people.cpp -o people.js -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_addPerson', '_getPeopleCount', '_getPeopleData', '_updatePositions']" -s EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS="['cwrap']"
